/**
 * This type of presenter is responsible for interaction with the viewState in a Model-View-Intent way.
 * It is the bridge that is responsible for setting up the reactive flow between "view" and "model".
 *
 * <p>
 * The methods {@link #bindIntents()} and {@link #unbindIntents()} are kind of representing the
 * lifecycle of this Presenter.
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #bindIntents()} is called the first time the view is attached </li>
 * <li>{@link #unbindIntents()} is called once the view is detached permanently because the view
 * has been destroyed and hence this presenter is not needed anymore and will also be destroyed
 * afterwards too.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This means that a presenter can survive orientation changes. During orientation changes (or when
 * the view is put on the back stack because the user navigated to another view) the view
 * will be detached temporarily and reattached to the presenter afterwards. To avoid memory leaks
 * this Presenter class offers two methods:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #intent(ViewIntentBinder)}</li>: Use this to bind an Observable intent from the view
 * <li>{@link #subscribeViewState(Observable, ViewStateConsumer)}: Use this to bind the ViewState
 * (a viewState is an object (typically a POJO) that holds all the data the view needs to display</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * By using {@link #intent(ViewIntentBinder)} and {@link #subscribeViewState(Observable, ViewStateConsumer)}
 * a relay will be established between the view and this presenter that allows the view to be
 * temporarily detached, without unsubscribing the underlying reactive business logic workflow and
 * without causing memory leaks (caused by recreation of the view).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Please note that the methods {@link #attachView(MvpView)} and {@link #detachView(boolean)}
 * should not be overridden unless you have a really good reason to do so. Usually {@link #bindIntents()}
 * and {@link #unbindIntents()} should be enough.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In very rare cases you could also use {@link #getViewStateObservable()} to offer an observable
 * to other components you can make this method public.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Please note that you should not reuse an MviBasePresenter once the View that originally has
 * instantiated this Presenter has been destroyed permanently</b>. App-wide singletons for
 * Presenters is not a good idea in Model-View-Intent. Reusing singleton-scoped Presenters for
 * different view instances may cause emitting the previous state of the previous attached view
 * (which already has been destroyed permanently).
 * </p>
