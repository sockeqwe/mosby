Hi there,
before you file a new issue please keep in mind that this is a issue tracker to
report bugs or make new feature requests.

If you have a general question of how to use Mosby or about the MVP or MVI pattern please check our [docs](http://hannesdorfmann.com/mosby/). If the docs don't provide the answer to your question 
we would really appreciate if you ask these kind of questions on [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com) rather than in github's issue tracker because we are pretty sure that you are not the first developer, nor the last one, who has the same kind of question. 
Unfortunately, github's issue tracker is not ver well indexed by search engines like Google whereas stackoverflow is. Hence, we would like to encourage you to ask such questions on stackoverflow and not here on github. Btw. there is a [Mosby tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mosby) on stackoverflow and we regularly keep looking on stackoverflow for new questions about Mosby.


With that said, if you want to report a bug or file a feature request, then go ahead.

If you want to report an issue, please use the following template to make it easier for us to identify the bug:

**Mosby Version:**

**Expected behavior**

**Actual behavior (include a stacktrace if crash)**

**Steps to reproduce the behavior or link to a sample repository**
